Neumorphism is a design concept used to make soft widgets based on object shadows. It uses highlights and shadows to create elements that appear to be floating above the surface.

### Introduction
Kerckoff's principle states that an encryption algorithm has to be secure. Everything else can be publicly disclosed, but the key must always be kept secret.

Security through obscurity does not work well because hackers maybe aware of the system's vulnerabilities.

### Goals
This tutorial will seek to accomplish the following goals:
- To explain the security of systems.
- To discuss different aspects of steganography and cryptanalysis.

### How Kerckoff's principle is applied in cryptography
#### The origin of Kerckoffâ€™s principle
A Dutch Linguistic cryptographer by the name Auguste Kerckoff wrote an article and published it in the journal of Military Sciences.

"La Cryptographer Militaire" means "Military Cryptography." He defined six major principles of cryptosystems.

### CRYPTOSYSTEMS FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES
The following are Kerckoff's priciples:

- In either practice or theory, the cryptosystem should be difficult to read and understand.

- Developers should use keys that are easy to modify and memorize without using notes.

- The system under encryption has to be simple. It should only contain a few lists of rules, and should not strain the mental capability.

- The design of the system should not be in secrecy. It should also not compromise other users' data.

- The documentation of the system should be easy to understand.

- The system must be able to transfer cryptograms.

The principles above are used in encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), El Gamal, and RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman).

### The Benefits Of Secret Keys
A secure cryptosystem enhances the security of a message while also solving the challenge of ensuring that the keys are short. 

A cryptosystem also requires long-term secrecy. The secret key completes the most difficult task and thus, overrides other security features. 

### How Does It Relate To Shannon Maxim
Claude Shannon expanded on Kerckoff's principle as a generated rule, which became known as the Open Design Principle.

According to Shannon, security and cryptographic design must assume that "the enemy knows the system."

During the Cold War, the United States National Security Agency (NSA) developed its system with the understanding that "any new device or software that was released was delivered to Moscow."

In other words, these two principles of cryptosystem conclude that security goals of a system do not rely on its secrecy. 

The origin of the cryptosystem is associated with the obfuscation of the private key and the use of any irregular privacy.

If everyone understands how the method of encryption and data transfer works, then the key should be kept safe. 

Even if a hacker is familiar with the system, he or she may be unsure of which of the probable cases is being monitored at a specific time.

It is critical to keep the key secret for security reasons. Making the key public will make it difficult to develop, test, and distribute new algorithms and applications. 

To distribute the keys, a simpler, less expensive test for generating and distributing information is required.

### Kerckoff's Principle Vs Security By Obscurity
Avoiding security by obscurity is the phrase used when explaining this concept. Security by obscurity is a method of keeping a security algorithm secret. Believing that the threat posed by an attacker is low. This is the same as putting your key in a flower vase next to your front door. One of the most often used examples is encrypting a password in binary code. Steganography is a type of security that works by hiding information. It entails concealing messages in various file forms, including audio and graphic files.

Once the attacker is aware of the security policy and mechanism, the algorithm is modified. The defensive mechanism in cyber security offers a false sense of security rather than actual security. Kerckoff's and Shannon Maxim's premises are opposed in terms of security through obscurity.It is risky to hackers who use reverse technology.

Industries ensure the security of the internal working of a cryptosystem is similar to that of a DVD and CSS.
The argument is that the end product could be more secure and less vulnerable  to attack as a result of this "security through obscurity."

### Conclusion
The above principle states that one should always assume the attacker  has the algorithm. As a result, we must rely on safeguarding the system's key secret.
