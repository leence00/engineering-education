### Introduction
Kerckoff's principle says that an encryption algorithm has to be secure; everything else can be publicly disclosed, but the key will always be kept secret.
Security through obscurity does not work because the adversary is well-versed in the system.
It consists of converting plaintexts to ciphertexts.

### How Kerckoff's Principle Is Applied In Cryptography
#### The Origin Of Kerckoffâ€™s Principle
A Dutch Linguistic cryptographer by the name Auguste Kerckoff wrote an article. In the journal of Military Sciences, "La Cryptographer Militaire" means "Military Cryptography." He defined six principles of cryptosystems.

### CRYPTOSYSTEMS FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- In either practice or theory the cryptosystem should be hard to read and understand.
- There is the use of keys, which are easy to modify and memorize without using notes.
- The system under encryption has to be simple, carry a few lists of rules, and should not strain the mental capability.
- The design of the system should not work with secrecy or privacy moreover its compromise should not be a problem to its correspondent users.
- The documentation of the system should be easy to port and allow use for one person.
- The system must be able to transfer cryptograms by the telegraph.
- All of the principles stated above  are used in all encryption algorithms, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), El Gamal, and RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman)

### The Benefits Of Secret Keys
- A secure cryptosystem enhances the security of a message while also solving the challenge of ensuring the keys are very short. As a cryptographic design, a system requires and can achieve long-term secrecy. The secret key completes the most difficult task and thus replaces all other keys. In case an intruder gets access to the secret key while the algorithm is very secure they will not intrude on the system, the key should be very secure. There are several approaches to learning how a commonly used system works.

- In a war, for example, one party will participate in opposing while the other will participate in supporting its equipment personnel. Both sides will attempt to gather information through the use of spies once more. The software is run under the control of a debugger to efficiently understand the method used. Hardware is not recommended because it can be removed and examined under a microscope for chip details. Furthermore, a user may purchase or steal some of the construct programs or devices that he wishes to test.

### How Does It Relate To Shannon Maxim
- Claude Shannon expanded on Kerckoff's principle as a generated rule, which became known as the Shannon Maxim, Open Design Principle Claude Shannon.
- According to Shannon's Maxim, security and cryptographic design must assume that "the enemy knows the system." This can be seen in the present as well as in the past. During the Cold War, the United States National Security Agency's (NSA) Center developed its system with the understanding that "any new device release was delivered to the Moscow."
- The two principles of cryptosystem states that security goals of a system do not rely on its secrecy. 

### The Principle's Explanation.
The origins of the cryptosystem are associated with the obfuscation of the private key and the use of any irregular privacy.If everyone understands how the method of encryption and data transfer works, the key should be kept safe. Even if a hacker is familiar with the system, he or she may be unsure of which of the probable cases is being monitored at every given time. A user is being monitored.

Cryptography can be accomplished by disseminating software and hardware. It is critical to keep the key secret for security reasons. Making the key public will make it difficult to develop, test, and distribute new algorithms and applications. It is critical to keep the algorithm secret, but the key should be kept even more so. To distribute the keys, a simpler, less expensive test for generating and distributing a new key is required.

### Kerckoff's Principle Vs Security By Obscurity
Avoiding security by obscurity is the phrase used when explaining this concept. Security by obscurity is a method of keeping a security algorithm secret. Believing that the threat posed by an attacker is low. This is the same as putting your key in a flower vase next to your front door. One of the most often used examples is encrypting a password in binary code. Steganography is a type of security that works by hiding information. It entails concealing messages in various file forms, including audio and graphic files.

Once the attacker is aware of the security policy and mechanism, the algorithm is modified. The defensive mechanism in cyber security offers a false sense of security rather than actual security. Kerckoff's and Shannon Maxim's premises are opposed in terms of security through obscurity.It is risky to hackers who use reverse technology.

Industries ensure the security of the internal working of a cryptosystem is similar to that of a DVD and CSS.
The argument is that the end product could be more secure and less vulnerable  to attack as a result of this "security through obscurity."

### Conclusion
The above  principle states that one should always assume the attacker  has the algorithm. As a result, we must rely on safeguarding the system's key secret.
