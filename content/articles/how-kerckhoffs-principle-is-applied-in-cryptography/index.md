### Introduction
According to Kerckoff's principle, a cryptosystem should be secure if everything except the key is known to the public.
Security through obscurity does not work because the adversary is well-versed in the system.
It consists of converting plaintexts to ciphertexts.

### How Kerckoff's Principle Is Applied In Cryptography
#### The Origin Of Kerckoff’s Principle
A Dutch Linguistic cryptographer by the name Auguste Kerckoff wrote an article. In the journal of Military Sciences, "La Cryptographer Militaire" means "Military Cryptography." He defined six principles of cryptosystems.

### CRYPTOSYSTEMS FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- In either practice or theory the cryptosystem should be hard to read and understand.
- There is the use of keys, which are easy to modify and memorize without using notes.
- The system under encryption has to be simple, carry a few lists of rules, and should not strain the mental capability.
- The design of the system should not work with secrecy or privacy moreover its compromise should not be a problem to its correspondent users.
- The documentation of the system should be easy to port and allow use for one person.
- The system must be able to transfer cryptograms by the telegraph.
- All of the principles stated above  are used in all encryption algorithms, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), El Gamal, and RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman)

### The Benefits Of Secret Keys
- Using a secure cryptosystem ensures the message's security while also resolving the difficult problem of keeping the keys short. As a cryptographic design, a system requires and can achieve long-term secrecy. The secret key completes the most difficult task and thus replaces all other keys. However, even if the attacker has access to the secret key while the system is very secure, the key should be kept secret. There are several approaches to learning how a commonly used system works.

- In a war, for example, one party will participate in opposing while the other will participate in supporting its equipment personnel. Both sides will attempt to gather information through the use of spies once more. The software is run under the control of a debugger to efficiently understand the method used. Hardware is not recommended because it can be removed and examined under a microscope for chip details. Furthermore, a user may purchase or steal some of the construct programs or devices that he wishes to test.

### How Does It Relate To Shannon Maxim
- Claude Shannon expanded on Kerckoff's principle as a generated rule, which became known as the Shannon Maxim, Open Design Principle Claude Shannon.
- According to Shannon's Maxim, security and cryptographic design must assume that "the enemy knows the system." This can be seen in the present as well as in the past. During the Cold War, the United States National Security Agency's (NSA) National Computer Security Center developed its system with the understanding that "number one of any new device was delivered to the Kremlin."
- The two principles agree that secrecy should not be used to guarantee security goals.

### The Principle's Explanation.
The cryptosystem's origins are concerned with the confidentiality of the secret key and the use of any random privacy. If everyone understands how the method of encryption and data transfer works, the key should be kept safe. Even if an attacker is familiar with the system in question, he or she may be unaware of which of the possible instances is being monitored at any given time. A user is being monitored.

Cryptography can be accomplished by disseminating software and hardware. It is critical to keep the key secret for security reasons. Making the key public will make it difficult to develop, test, and distribute new algorithms and applications. It is critical to keep the algorithm secret, but the key should be kept even more so.To distribute the keys, a simpler, less expensive test for generating and distributing a new key is required.

### Kerckoff's Principle Vs Security By Obscurity
Avoiding security by obscurity is the phrase used when explaining this concept. Security by obscurity is a method of keeping a security algorithm secret. Believing that the threat posed by an attacker is low. This is the same as putting your key in a flower vase next to your front door. One of the most often used examples is encrypting a password in binary code. Steganography is a type of security that works by hiding information. It entails concealing messages in various file forms, including audio and graphic files.

Once the attacker is aware of the security policy and mechanism, the algorithm is modified. In cyber security, the protective mechanism provides a false sense of security rather than true security. Kerckoff's and Shannon Maxim's premises are diametrically opposed in terms of security through obscurity. It is vulnerable to attackers, such as those who use reverse engineering.

Companies can secure the inner workings of their systems in the same way that they can with CSS and DVDs.
It could be argued that the product is more secure and less vulnerable to attack as a result of this "security through obscurity."
Although hiding the insides may improve security in the short term, one counter-argument claims that only systems that have been published and analyzed can be trusted in the long run.

### Conclusion
This principle states that we should always assume the attacker already has the algorithm. As a result, we must rely on safeguarding the system's key secret.
